# WasmSnakeGame

First full project ive built in other language's as well. Like to see difference between them all. Saving instead of losing on my computer somewhere. 

Initial commits few items to fix still

I find this combination of technologies very cool

Using the same technologies but with a DB and crud functionality with one of the routing frameworks would be pretty cool and something I would likely use as boiler plate for other stuff for myself in the future
